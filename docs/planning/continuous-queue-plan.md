# Continuous product queue (PLAN-02)

**Date:** 2026-08-31  
**Baseline:** `main` @ `877a529` (W2.2 Routing assurance next-hop/subject fields, [#338](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/pull/338))  
**PLAN issue:** [PLAN-02 #339](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/339)  
**Normative execution order:** [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) §3.C

This is the in-repo plan (`.omx/plans/` is gitignored). It replaces the idle state **NEXT = none**.

## Why the previous queue stopped work

| Stopper | Evidence | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Empty `ROADMAP.md` §3 | `NEXT = none` after P2-11 + post-queue UX | `/autopilot` reports and **idles** |
| W5 labelled “PLAN only” | [`desktop-ui-backend-alignment.md`](../development/desktop-ui-backend-alignment.md) | P3 work waits for a PLAN that was never opened |
| Lab phase gates (GNS3 / CHR / `WriteEnabled`) | `~/gns3-lab` (outside git); [`known-limitations.md`](../release/known-limitations.md) live CHR **OFF** | Operators treat phase N as a product stop — **not a MUST in this repo** |
| ROADMAP §6 “no skip predecessors” | Correct **inside** the product line | Misread as “wait for lab phase close” |

**Rule (PLAN-02):** closing a delivery wave without seeding the next §3 row in the same cycle is forbidden. Lab/CHR/`WriteEnabled` run **in parallel** and are **never** predecessors of Desktop/Contracts PRs.

## Readiness (evidence vs inference)

### Code / normative milestones (evidence)

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| MVP M0–M6 + N1 | **100% CLOSED** | 109/109 |
| Post-MVP M7.1–M7.4 | **100% CLOSED** | `v0.2.0` (2026-08-24) |
| P2 read P2-04…P2-06 | **CLOSED** | `Mfc:RouterOs:Enabled` fail-closed default |
| P2 write P2-07…P2-11 | **CLOSED** | `WriteEnabled` fail-closed default — **do not** flip to wake UI |
| Desktop alignment W1.1–W4.4, W2.1–W2.2 | **DONE** | P0–P2 UI ↔ existing RPC |
| Product issues in `ISSUES.md` §2.2 | **139 DONE** | Tracker aligned TRACKER-01 |

### Operational / lab (evidence)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Live CHR / physical CRS in CI | **OFF** (scripted Living Specs are DoD) |
| Default `WriteEnabled` | **false** (correct fail-closed) |
| GNS3 lab (`~/gns3-lab`) | Outside this git repo; day-2 / write unlock is **ops**, not §3 |

### Remaining product glue (evidence — not W5)

| Gap | Where | Queue ID |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Rollback Start without Watch | `DeploymentViewModel.RollbackAsync` vs `StartAndWatchAsync` | **CONT-01 DONE** |
| Neighbor apply ignores VRRP member b | `AddRouterWizardViewModel.ApplyNeighborCandidate` | **CONT-02 DONE** |

### P3 / new Contracts (evidence)

| Gap | Queue ID |
|-----|----------|
| No `ListPolicies` in `policy.proto` (catalog browse) | **W5-01 DONE** |
| No Desktop RPC for ManagementPath / FastTrack | **W5-02** |
| Deployment `semantic_diff_entries` is `repeated string` | **W5-03** |
| CRS / physical lab runner | **Not §3** — residual in known-limitations; ops parallel |

### Deferred / not this tranche (evidence)

- `StartCapture` `node_id` — Controller comment, M1-26 deferred; larger API than CONT glue
- Policies “Save and Deploy” — MVP scope lock
- Local Desktop `SemanticDiffEngine` — anti-goal
- Auto-fix drift — anti-goal
- Fake VRRP Master/Backup labels without capture facts — anti-goal

## Dual track (product never waits on lab)

```text
Product §3.C (linear, one NEXT)     Ops / lab (parallel, never blocks §3)
─────────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────────
PLAN-02 docs **DONE** (#345)        GNS3 day-2 fixture (out of git)
CONT-01 Rollback Watch **DONE**      Isolated WriteEnabled=true lab
CONT-02 Neighbor → member b **DONE** Live CHR when an isolated runner exists
W5-01 ListPolicies **DONE**
W5-02 ManagementPath / FastTrack
W5-03 Typed deploy policy diff
```

`/autopilot` always takes **§3 NEXT**. It does not wait for lab phase transitions.

## Linear queue (one PR each)

| Order | ID | GitHub | Scope | Status |
|------:|----|-------:|-------|--------|
| 1 | PLAN-02 | [#339](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/339) | Seed §3.C + process | **DONE** ([#345](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/pull/345)) |
| 2 | CONT-01 | [#340](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/340) | Rollback + Watch (existing RPC) | **DONE** |
| 3 | CONT-02 | [#341](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/341) | Neighbor apply → VRRP member b | **DONE** |
| 4 | W5-01 | [#342](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/342) | `ListPolicies` catalog browse | **DONE** |
| 5 | W5-02 | [#343](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/343) | ManagementPath / FastTrack Desktop | **NEXT** |
| 6 | W5-03 | [#344](https://github.com/sesquicadaver/MTDirector/issues/344) | Typed deployment semantic policy diff | OPEN |

**NEXT = W5-02 (#343).** W5-01 is closed.

When W5-03 merges, the closing PR must either (a) seed the next PLAN tranche in the same cycle, or (b) document an explicit residual (CRS lab stays ops). Empty §3 without that sentence is a process defect.

## Anti-goals (unchanged)

- Local SemanticDiffEngine on Desktop
- `WriteEnabled=true` “so the UI works”
- Auto-fix drift / Save and Deploy
- Fake VRRP role labels
- Treating GNS3 phase N as a Desktop/Contracts stop-gate

## DoD per product PR

Issue AC; Living Spec row; CHANGELOG; CI Linux validate + Windows Desktop; no `pass` / `NotImplemented`; Domain/App ↛ RouterOS; this plan + alignment + ROADMAP NEXT advanced in the same PR.
